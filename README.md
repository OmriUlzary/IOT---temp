# IOT---temp
In this assignment, we got a dataset that contains the inside and the outside temperature readings from the IOT device in 5 months and we were asked to analyze it. Besides learning about the data and analyzing it, the purpose of the assignment was to learn how to analyze the data we received in several ways and finally to examine what is the most effective way to do this.    In the first section, we read about the background on dataset measurement.    In part 2, we explored the data. Firstly, we import the data from a CSV file to Python. We learned about the shape form of the data structure - the number of rows and columns. Afterward, we calculated statistics values to the “temp” column.    In part 3 we were asked to build statistical functions ourselves, without using "Pandas" and afterward, to compare those functions to functions with "Pandas".    In part 4 of the assignment, we built queries in purpose to learn more about the data we were given to explore.    In part 5, we selected 5 selected questions from Part 4, build for them a plot and display their results with matplotlib on purpose reach further conclusions about the data visually.
